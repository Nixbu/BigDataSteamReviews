## **General Functionality**

This project analyzes massive Steam review datasets to reveal patterns in gaming behavior and market dynamics.

### **Data Processing**
* **High-Volume Processing**: Handles 21 million Steam reviews efficiently using DuckDB
* **Data Cleaning**: Processes raw CSV data, excluding review text to focus on metadata
* **Sampling**: Creates manageable 500-row samples for each analysis table
* **Multi-Database Support**: Exports processed data from DuckDB to SQLite for web applications

### **Analytics & Insights**
* **Game Popularity Analysis**: Total reviews, positive review percentages, and trending metrics
* **User Behavior Patterns**: Playtime analysis, addiction indicators, and engagement metrics
* **Market Demographics**: Language-based user analysis and purchasing behavior
* **Temporal Trends**: Quarter-by-quarter game popularity tracking
* **User Segmentation**: Demographics analysis by gaming habits and preferences

### **Interactive Visualization**
* **Web Dashboard**: Streamlit-based interface with multiple analysis sections
* **Graph Database Visualization**: Interactive network graphs showing user-game-review relationships
* **Dynamic Charts**: Bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and time series visualizations
* **Filtering Capabilities**: Interactive dropdowns and multi-select options for data exploration

## **Technologies Used**

### **Data Processing**
* Python 3.x
* DuckDB (High-performance analytics)
* SQLite (Web application storage)
* Pandas (Data manipulation)
* CSV Processing (21M+ records)

### **Visualization**
* Streamlit (Web dashboard)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Statistical plots)
* Plotly (Interactive charts)
* NetworkX (Graph analysis)
* Pyvis (Interactive network visualization)

### **Database**
* DuckDB (OLAP workloads)
* SQLite (OLTP operations)

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
* Python 3.8+
* pip package manager
* 8GB+ RAM (for processing large datasets)
* Original `steam_reviews.csv` file (21M records)

### **1. Environment Setup**
```bash
pip install duckdb sqlite3 streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly networkx pyvis
```

### **2. Data Processing**
1. Place your `steam_reviews.csv` file in the project root
2. Run the data processing pipeline:
```bash
python db_queries.py
```
This will:
- Create `steam_reviews_db.duckdb` with analysis tables
- Generate `steam_reviews_samples_500.db` SQLite database
- Export 500-row samples for web visualization

### **3. Launch Visualizations**
**Main Dashboard:**
```bash
streamlit run visualise.py
```

**Graph Network Visualization:**
```bash
streamlit run steam_graph.py
```

## **Database Information**

### **DuckDB Schema**
The main analytics database contains:
- `steam_reviews` - Full 21M record dataset
- `question1_1` through `question5` - Analysis result tables
- Sample tables with `_samples_500` suffix

### **SQLite Schema**
Web application database contains 500-row samples:
```sql
steam_reviews_sample_500
question1_1_samples_500  -- Total reviews per game
question1_2_samples_500  -- Positive review analysis
question1_3_samples_500  -- High-volume games (500k+ reviews)
question2_1_samples_500  -- Highest playtime records
question2_2_samples_500  -- Total playtime per game
question2_3_samples_500  -- Daily average playtime
question3_1_samples_500  -- Reviews by language
question3_2_samples_500  -- Purchasing users by language
question4_samples_500    -- Trending games by quarter
question5_samples_500    -- User demographics analysis
```

## **Key Insights**

### **Major Discoveries**
* **Popularity â‰  Quality**: Popular games like PUBG have mixed reviews (53.91% positive) while niche games achieve near-perfect ratings
* **Addiction Indicators**: Games like Black Desert Online average 5.6 hours of daily playtime
* **Market Opportunities**: Emerging markets (Vietnam, Brazil) show high engagement and 94%+ recommendation rates
* **Cultural Barriers**: East Asian markets show high playtime but lower satisfaction (56-70% recommendations)

### **Business Intelligence**
* **Localization Impact**: Cultural adaptation significantly affects user satisfaction
* **Engagement vs. Satisfaction**: High playtime doesn't guarantee positive reviews
* **Market Segmentation**: User behavior varies dramatically by language and region
* **Trend Analysis**: Quarterly patterns reveal seasonal gaming preferences

## **Known Limitations**

* **Sample Size**: Web visualizations use 500-row samples for performance
* **Memory Requirements**: Full dataset processing requires significant RAM
* **Review Text**: Excluded from analysis due to size and processing complexity
* **Real-time Updates**: Static dataset analysis, not live Steam data
* **Temporal Coverage**: Analysis limited to historical review data timeframe
